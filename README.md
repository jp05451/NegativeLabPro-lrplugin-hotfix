## Note
Above method should work on macOS and Windows but files are from Windows version of this plug-in. If you find better way of activating this let me know. I am currently trying to locate file that stores information about license and activation status of this plug-in.

I tested it on iMac Pro 2017 with macOS High Sierra, for me it works
